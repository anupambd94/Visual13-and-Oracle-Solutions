Angular provides properties on forms that help us validate them. They give us various information about a form or its inputs and are applied to a form and inputs.
---------------------------------------------------
Property	Class	Description
$valid	ng-valid	Boolean Tells whether an item is currently valid based on the rules you placed.
$invalid	ng-invalid	Boolean Tells whether an item is currently invalid based on the rules you placed.
$pristine	ng-pristine	Boolean True if the form/input has not been used yet.
$dirty	ng-dirty	Boolean True if the form/input has been used.
$touched	ng-touched	Boolean True if the input has been blurred.


----------------------------
Accessing Angular Form Properties
----------------------------------
To access the form: <form name>.<angular property>
To access an input: <form name>.<input name>.<angular property>

-----------------------------
Add Index.html and app.js file..
----------------------------
A few key points to note here:

novalidate: This will prevent the default HTML5 validations since we'll be doing that ourselves (ours will be much prettier)
We have applied ng-model to our inputs so that we have data from our forms bound to Angular variables
ng-minlength and ng-maxlength on username will create those rules
The name input is required
The email input is type="email"
