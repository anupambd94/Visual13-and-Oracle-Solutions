------------------------------------
In this video we will discuss 
1. ng-repeat directive in Angular
2. Nesting ng-repeat with an example

ng-repeat is similar to foreach loop in C#. 

Let us understand this with an example. Here is what we want to do.
1. For each employee we have in the employees array we want a table row. With in each cell of the table row we to display employee
Firstname
Lastname
Gender
Salary

This can be achieved very easily using ng-repeat directive.

HtmlPage1.html : In the view, we are using ng-repeat directive which loops thru each employee in employees array. For each employee, we a get a table row, and in each table cell of the table row, the respective employee details (Firstname, Lastname, Gender, Salary) are retrieved using the angular binding expression.

Nested ng-repeat example : The model contains an array of countries, and each country has an array of cities. The view must display cities nested under their respective country.

Finding the index of an item in the collection : 
To find the index of an item in the collection use $index property
To get the index of the parent element
 Use $parent.$index or
 Use ng-init="parentIndex = $index"

var myApp = angular
    .module("myModule", [])
    .controller("myController", function ($scope) {
        var Countrees = [
            {
                Name: "Bangladesh",
                Capital: "Dhaka",
                cities: [
                    { name: "Dhaka"},
                    { name: "khulna" },
                    { name: "Chitagong" }
                ]
            },
            {
                Name: "India",
                Capital: "New Delhi",
                cities: [
                    { name: "kalkata" },
                    { name: "Dilhi" },
                    { name: "New delhi" }
                ]
            },
            {
                Name: "Pakistan",
                Capital: "Karachi",
                cities: [
                    { name: "karachi" },
                    { name: "Ambani" },
                    { name: "Some More" }
                ]
            }
        ];
        
        
        $scope.Countrees = Countrees;
        $scope.Message = "Countiees";

});

How to use:
----------------
<div>
        <h1>{{Message}}</h1> @*Using the variables...*@

    </div>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>Capital</td>
            <td>Cities</td>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr ng-repeat="anyObjectName in Countrees">
                <td>{{anyObjectName.Name}}</td>
                <td>{{anyObjectName.Capital}}</td>
                <td >
                    <ul>
                        <li ng-repeat="anotherObjectName in anyObjectName.cities">
                            {{anotherObjectName.name}}
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
